# Introduction

```{r Format Data}
redType <- red %>% mutate(type = "red")
whiteType <- white %>% mutate(type = "white")
wines <- bind_rows(redType, whiteType)
randomizeRows <- sample(seq(1, nrow(wines)), nrow(wines))
wines <- wines[randomizeRows, ]
```


## Description

I used the Wine Quality Data Set. This data comes from Dr. Paulo Cortez and
their pursuit to predict wine quality preferences [@cortez2009modeling]. The
data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@lichman2013uci].

The data analyzed included two datasets, one related to red *vinho verde* and
the other related to white *vinho verde*. Each of the two datasets contain
twelve variables, one of which was the participant's quality score for that wine
[@lichman2013uci]. This analysis will use both datasets, either in one dataset
or two separate datasets and focusing on one type of wine.


## Wine Characteristics

The red wine dataset has `r nrow(red)` samples while the white wine dataset has
`r nrow(white)` samples. It was not clear from the reference paper on how they
collected the data besides being tested "at the official certification entity
(CVRVV)" [@cortez2009modeling].

The available physicochemical variables are:

1. fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm^3^)
2. volatile acidity (g(acetic acid)/dm^3^)
3. citric acid (g/dm^3^)
4. residual sugar (g/dm^3^)
5. chlorides (g(sodium chloride)/dm^3^)
6. free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm^3^)
7. total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm^3^)
8. density (g/cm^3^)
9. pH
10. sulphates (g(potassium sulphate)/dm^3^)
11. alcohol (vol.%)

These variables will be used in the machine learning analysis.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Correlations

```{r red, fig.cap=figure1}
redCorr <- redType %>% select(-type) %>% cor
redCorr %>% corrplot(type = "lower")
```

```{r white, fig.cap=figure2}
whiteCorr <- whiteType %>% select(-type) %>% cor
whiteCorr %>% corrplot(type = "lower")
```

```{r wines, fig.cap=figure3}
winesCorr <- wines %>% select(-type) %>% cor
winesCorr %>% corrplot(type = "lower")
```

Figures 1, 2, and 3 show heatmaps generated from correlation matrices from just
white wine data, just red wine data, and the combination of both wines into one.


### Comparisons Between White and Red

In this report, I will be differentiating between red and white wine types.
Firstly, I will need to combine the two separate wine datasets. Here I will
explore potential issues in combining the data.

When combining the data, I will explore the distribution of each of the wine
attributes for both wines are similar. This compatability between data sets will
lessen any bias or inherent structure in the data. Any underlying structure in
the combined data may give a machine learning algorithm information on
predicting wine type not found in the attributes.

```{r Compare Red/White Fixed Acidity, fig.cap=compareFixed}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(fixed.acidity, color = type)) + geom_density() +
    xlab("Chlorides") + ylab("Density") +
    guides(color = guide_legend("Type")) + theme_minimal()
```

Figure 4 shows one example of the shared distribution of chlorides, separated by
wine type. Here we see that both types of wine share a similar distribution
shape. This suggests that this attribute will not be too helpful in
differentiating between the wine types.

```{r Compare Red/White Cloride, fig.cap=compareChloride}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(chlorides, color = type)) + geom_density() +
    xlab("Chlorides") + ylab("Density") +
    guides(color = guide_legend("Type")) + theme_minimal()
```

### Normality and Skew

I will now take a look at the data to see and note any unusual samples or
attributes. All of our attributes are numerical, except for the wine type. For
simplicity, we will assume and transform our data to as close to a normal
distribution as possible.

```{r Wines pH, fig.cap=figure4}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(pH)) + geom_histogram() + ylab("Count") + theme_minimal()
```

The variables pH and quality appear to be normal enough. Shown in Figure 4
is the distribution of pH values. The distribution appears good enough to be
normal. The values for quality follow a similar distribution.

```{r Wines Citric Acid, fig.cap=figure5}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(citric.acid)) + geom_histogram() +
    ylab("Count") + theme_minimal()
```

There are six attributes which have outliers. These attributes are citric acid
concentration, free sulfur dioxide concentration, total sulfur dioxide, sulfur
dioxide concentration, density, and sulphates concentration. Figure 5 shows a
plot of the citric acid distribution, whereby you can see the bulk of the
distribution and extreme values to the right. The other three attribute with
outliers have similar shapes. Despite having outliers, the overall distribution
of these attributes follows a normal distribution.

```{r Wines Chlorides, fig.cap=figure6}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(chlorides)) + geom_histogram() +
    ylab("Count") + theme_minimal()
```

```{r Wines log(Chlorides), fig.cap=figure7}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(chlorides %>% log)) + geom_histogram() +
    xlab("Chloride Content") + ylab("Count") + theme_minimal()
```

Lastly, there are four attributes which have enough skew in their distribution 
which warrent a transformation. These attributes are fixed acidity, volatile 
acidity, residual sugar content, and chlorides. Figure 6 shows the raw values 
for chloride. The distribution of chloride values is highly skews and will be 
logarithm transformed to take a more normal distribution. The result of a
natural logarithm transformation is shown in Figure 7.

```{r Normalize Data}
wines <- wines %>%
    mutate(fixed.acidity = log(fixed.acidity)) %>%
    mutate(volatile.acidity = log(volatile.acidity)) %>%
    mutate(residual.sugar = log(residual.sugar)) %>%
    mutate(chlorides = log(chlorides))
```

## Predict Red and White Wine

I hypothesize that there are enough physicochemical differences between red and
white wines that a learning algorithm will be able to differentiate between the
two.

```{r Predict Red and White Wine, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Decision tree analysis
dtResults <- run_decision_tree_type(wines, "type", "class")

# Naive Bayes analysis
nbResults <- run_naive_bayes(wines, "type")

# SVM analysis
svmResults <- run_svm_type(wines, "type")
```

```{r}

```


## Predict Wine Quality

```{r Predict Wine Quality}
dtQuality <- run_decision_tree_type(wines, "quality", "class")
svmQualityLinear <- run_svm_type(wines, "quality", kernel = "linear")
svmQualityRadial <- run_svm_type(wines, "quality", kernel = "radial")
svmQualityPoly <- run_svm_type(wines, "quality", kernel = "polynomial")
```
