# Introduction

# Data

I used the Wine Quality Data Set. This data comes from Dr. Paulo Cortez and
their pursuit to predict wine quality preferences [@cortez2009modeling]. The
data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@lichman2013uci].

The data analyzed included two datasets, one related to red *vinho verde* and
the other related to white *vinho verde*. Each of the two datasets contain
twelve variables, one of which was the participant's quality score for that wine
[@lichman2013uci].
