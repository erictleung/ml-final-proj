# Introduction

# Wine Dataset

```{r EDA}
redType <- red %>% mutate(type = "red")
whiteType <- white %>% mutate(type = "white")
wines <- bind_rows(redType, whiteType)
randomizeRows <- sample(seq(1, nrow(wines)), nrow(wines))
wines <- wines[randomizeRows, ]
```


## Description

I used the Wine Quality Data Set. This data comes from Dr. Paulo Cortez and
their pursuit to predict wine quality preferences [@cortez2009modeling]. The
data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@lichman2013uci].

The data analyzed included two datasets, one related to red *vinho verde* and
the other related to white *vinho verde*. Each of the two datasets contain
twelve variables, one of which was the participant's quality score for that wine
[@lichman2013uci]. This analysis will use both datasets, either in one dataset
or two separate datasets and focusing on one type of wine.


## Wine Characteristics

The red wine dataset has `r nrow(red)` samples while the white wine dataset has
`r nrow(white)` samples. It was not clear from the reference paper on how they
collected the data besides being tested "at the official certification entity
(CVRVV)" [@cortez2009modeling].

The available physicochemical variables are:

1. fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm^3^)
2. volatile acidity (g(acetic acid)/dm^3^)
3. citric acid (g/dm^3^)
4. residual sugar (g/dm^3^)
5. chlorides (g(sodium chloride)/dm^3^)
6. free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm^3^)
7. total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm^3^)
8. density (g/cm^3^)
9. pH
10. sulphates (g(potassium sulphate)/dm^3^)
11. alcohol (vol.%)

These variables will be used in the machine learning analysis.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Correlations

```{r red, fig.cap=figure1}
redCorr <- red %>% select(-type) %>% cor
redCorr %>% corrplot(type = "lower")
```

```{r fig.cap=figure2}
whiteCorr <- white %>% select(-type) %>% cor
whiteCorr %>% corrplot(type = "lower")
```

```{r fig.cap=figure3}
winesCorr <- wines %>% select(-type) %>% cor
winesCorr %>% corrplot(type = "lower")
```

Figures 1, 2, and 3 show heatmaps generated from correlation matrices from just
white wine data, just red wine data, and the combination of both wines into one.


## Normality and Skew

I will now take a look at the data to see and note any unusual samples or
attributes. All of our attributes are numerical, except for the wine type. For
simplicity, we will assume and transform our data to as close to a normal
distribution as possible.

```{r fig.cap=figure4}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(pH)) + geom_histogram() + ylab("Count")
```

The variables pH and quality appear to be normal enough. Shown in Figure 4
is the distribution of pH values. The distribution appears good enough to be
normal. The values for quality follow a similar distribution.

```{r fig.cap=figure5}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(citric.acid)) + geom_histogram() + ylab("Count")
```

There are six attributes which have outliers. These attributes are citric acid
concentration, free sulfur dioxide concentration, total sulfur dioxide, sulfur
dioxide concentration, density, and sulphates concentration. Figure 5 shows a
plot of the citric acid distribution, whereby you can see the bulk of the
distribution and extreme values to the right. The other three attribute with
outliers have similar shapes. Despite having outliers, the overall distribution
of these attributes follows a normal distribution.

```{r fig.cap=figure6}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(chlorides)) + geom_histogram() + ylab("Count")
```

```{r fig.cap=figure7}
wines %>% ggplot(aes(chlorides %>% log)) + geom_histogram() +
    xlab("Chloride Content") + ylab("Count")
```

Lastly, there are four attributes which have enough skew in their distribution 
which warrent a transformation. These attributes are fixed acidity, volatile 
acidity, residual sugar content, and chlorides. Figure 6 shows the raw values 
for chloride. The distribution of chloride values is highly skews and will be 
logarithm transformed to take a more normal distribution. The result of a
natural logarithm transformation is shown in Figure 7.

```{r Normalize Data}
wines <- wines %>%
    mutate(fixed.acidity = log(fixed.acidity)) %>%
    mutate(volatile.acidity = log(volatile.acidity)) %>%
    mutate(residual.sugar = log(residual.sugar)) %>%
    mutate(chlorides = log(chlorides))
```


# Methods

## Linear Regression

## Decision Trees

## Support Vector Machine

## Naive Bayes Classifier

# Results

## Predict Red and White Wine

I hypothesize that there are enough physicochemical differences between red and
white wines that a learning algorithm will be able to differentiate between the
two.
